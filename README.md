# LabCode
Repository of the Python code developed in the GroeblacherLab at Delft University of Technology.

This folder currently contains:
  - Library to create servers
  - Server for an optical wavemeter and GUI for laser lock (in the wavemeter_and_laser_lock folder)

We are an academic research group working on quantum optomechanics and develop code to control our equipment and run experiments. As writing code for every single tool takes a lot of time and effort, we would like to share it with everyone out there who uses similar tools and hope it will be used by as many people as possible. While most of our research is highly specialized, we hope that our code will find applications in many areas beyond quantum physics. The only thing we ask in return is to be acknowledged for our contribution (hence we use the GNU AGPLv3 license for all our code) and hope that using our code helps others to save precious time. Please let us know if you find bugs, if you added new features or have other ideas for improvments and feel free to share our repository with anyone you think would like to use it. If you're interested in the work we do, please visit https://www.groeblacherlab.org

 If you find our code useful and use it, please cite as described in the CITATION.cff file.
